# PWA Basic Boilerplate

A very basic boilerplate for creating PWAs using Google's [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/). 


## Usage

This boilerplate is available as a `npm` module on [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pwa-boilerplate-basic). 

Since `script + npx = speed` we will use `npx` here.

Choose a folder where you want to create your application and type :

```bash
npx pwa-boilerplate-basic app-name
```

This will install required items for a basic bare bones PWA(including node modules).

To run **development server** first switch to your app directory and use :

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a development server which will be on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Requirements

Since this is a npm package you might already know that node + npm are required (If not, then you visited wrong part of the internet :) ).

Node version 5.2+ is required.

## TODO

- [ ] Learn `parcel` or other module bundler to improve this project.
- [ ] Add styling to application.
- [ ] Add more basic features so that add can be showcased.
